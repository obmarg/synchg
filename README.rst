synchg
======

When developing a cross platform application, it can be neccesary to transfer
changes between different machines running different operating systems.
Mercurials push & pull help a lot to make this process a lot simpler than it
could be. However the process of syncing repositories can take quite a few
steps if (like me) you rebase and collapse changesets quite frequently, and
especially if you like to make use of the mq extension.

This script intends to make the process of syncing two mercurial repositories
to exactly the same point as easy as possible, by taking care of all the steps
neccesary in a single command.
